Methodology
==========================================================
-   For each detected edge, one of the following options:
    -   if it's non-ambiguous, state NON-AMB, without code follow-up
If paths are ambiguous:
-   Total number of paths for each edge
-   Count number of correct paths until the first false path is reached. Or if paths look reasonably false.
-   For first false positive path, explanation, why it was not detected.

Ambiguous paths evaluation methodology:
-   Identify points of ambiguity.
-   For each variable that may have ambiguous points-to, run a CHA dataflow analysis to identify locations where
    variable was assigned, from Android Studio, by using feature "Analyze dataflow to here".
    Check whether the value chosen in our path is indeed feasible.

Treats to validity:
-   We verify validity from points-to perspective only. A path determined by us to be feasible might still be
    infeasible due to complex path conditions required to access it.
    We didn't encoutner such complex paths so far.
